###  Implement the Visual Studio Code debugging tools for C#

## Prerequisites
    An installation of Visual Studio Code that's configured for C# application development.
    Ability to develop C# console applications that implement business logic using iteration statements, selection statements, and custom methods.
    A basic understanding of code debuggers and the debug process.

    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides debugging tools for C# development through extensions like "C# for Visual Studio Code." Here are some basic steps to use the debugging tools in VS Code for C#:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer.

2. **Install the C# Extension:**
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon on the sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
   - Search for "C#" and install the "C# for Visual Studio Code" extension provided by Microsoft.

3. **Create a C# Project:**
   - Create a new C# project or open an existing one in VS Code. You can use the .NET CLI to create a new project.
   - Make sure your project has the necessary configuration files like `launch.json` for debugging.

4. **Set Breakpoints:**
   - Open the C# source code file where you want to set breakpoints.
   - Click in the left margin next to the line numbers to set breakpoints. Breakpoints are used to pause the program's execution for inspection.

5. **Run and Debug:**
   - Open the file you want to debug.
   - Click the "Run and Debug" button on the left sidebar or press `F5`.
   - If you don't have a `launch.json` configuration file, VS Code will help you create one.
   - Select the debugging configuration (e.g., ".NET Core Launch (console)").

6. **Start Debugging:**
   - After configuring the launch options, press `F5` or click the green play button in the top menu to start debugging.
   - Your program will run, and it will pause at the breakpoints you set. You can use debugging controls like Step Over, Step Into, Continue, and so on to navigate through your code.

7. **Inspect Variables:**
   - While debugging, you can inspect the values of variables by hovering over them or using the Variables and Watch panes in the debugging view.
   - You can also use the Debug Console to execute C# expressions during debugging.

8. **Stop Debugging:**
   - When you're done debugging, you can stop the debugging session by clicking the red square "Stop" button or by pressing `Shift+F5`.

9. **Review Output:**
   - The Debug Console displays program output and debugging information as you run and debug your code.

These are the basic steps to use the Visual Studio Code debugging tools for C#. The debugging experience in VS Code is powerful and helps you find and fix issues in your C# programs efficiently.
